# HomeDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.2.

I created this app as a playground to learn some of the ins and outs of Angular 2. It's intended to be a working "dashboard" for a smart home. Currently running the following modules/components
- Clock (This module subscribes to a service to update a clock object)
- News Feed (Retrieves an rss news feed and displays a number of the most recent entries).
- IP Camera (Embeds live video from a local ip-camera)
- Weather (Embeds Environment Canada's weather applet).

Currently as a base, some of the code/components were implemented following various tutorials online.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
